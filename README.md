# App Center
> Instantly access your favorite apps from Control Center

Weâ€™ve all been there.  Chatting with a friend while trying to keep up with the social media timeline, that casual game or the latest news headlines. More often than not, you find yourself repeating the same sequence of click, tap, tap, clicka-click, tap in order to switch between two or more apps. What if this could be reduced to just one swipe?  
**Introducing App Center.**

## Features

* A new page in Control Center presents your recently used apps to you.  
* Tap an app to open add it as an app page inside Control Center, granting instant access every time you open Control Center.  
* Tap and hold to open the app in full screen.  
* Smart swiping: App Center knows when you want to quickly swipe to another Control Center page and prevents unintended interaction with the page'd apps.  
* Efficient memory handling prevents wasting of battery life and system resources.
